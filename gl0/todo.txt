// Optimization steps
Your process should look like
0. simplest implementation with basic optimization ->
1. heavily optimized implementation ->
2. multi threaded version of 1. ->
3. move to GPU if testing a prototype version shows an improvement(edited)

MAIN TODO
	collision detection and response - bounding boxes
		which library? bounce or bullet
	level generator
	ability ot switch levels
	menu screen
	pause capability
	sound
	-------------------------------------------------
	loading screen either using async or other threading - done
	camera on a rail system - done
	read a level and its campath file - done
	camera follows campath - done
	camera should follow campath smoothly - done

refactoring
	pull update outside of main.cpp
	reduce globals using state objects
	-------------------------------------------------
	separate octree into header and cpp file - done
	compile lib fmt and glm into a dll and add it to the project - done
	move header and cpps into same directory - done
	Fix names: all types and functions InThisCase and all variables in_this_case - done
	pull rendering system outside of main.cpp - done

campath editor - ideally scrap and generate during level generation
	-------------------------------------------------
	show coords on hover - planning to skip
	move control points - planning to skip
	delete control points - planning to skip
	add control points - planning to skip
	get campath control pts from a ppm - done
	write cam path files - done
	
collision detection
	+narrow phase collision detection and response
	+only check collisions for dynamic objects - need library
	-------------------------------------------------
	+only draw cells with list.size() > 0  - done
	+use center for now - done
	+verify postion to grid coord is working - done
	+draw object positions to make sure its center of object - done
	+update grid node lists each frame - done
	+let object be in more than one cell at once - done
	+write method to print the nearest neighbors - done
	+add bounding box to each object, consider spherical - done

	NOTES
	+keep separate list of stationary and moving objects
	+use distance squared instead of actual distance
	+do a coarse check before doing a granular check
	+does collision checking need to be done every frame?


level generator
	terrain creation : generate levels and campaths

need gravity
entity states

main loop should run based on level text data - done
  object state machine based properties - done

finish opengl lighting section 


RESOURCED NEEDED
