```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Functions and their examples
```{r chnk1}
library(magrittr)

vnorm = function(x) {
  # euclidean norm of vector
  ( t(x) %*% x ) %>% sqrt
}
angle = function(x,y) acos(crossprod(x,y)/(vnorm(x) * vnorm(y))) * (180/pi)

a1 = c(0,1,0,0.7)
a2 = c(0.2,0,0,1.7805)
vnorm(a1)
vnorm(a2)
angle(a1,a2)
```

## Problem and solution
The problem states that all columns have a vector norm of 1, i.e.
$for\ all\ i,\ a_i^{T}a_i = 1$. It also states that
each column has an angle of 60 degrees with every other column, i.e.
$for\ i \neq j,\ a_i^Ta_j = cos(\pi/3)$.

**Describe the gram matrix of A**, $G = A^{T}A$. The gram matrix describes, in
a compact way, the value of the inner product for each pair of columns. 

```{r chnk2}
G = diag(x=1,nrow=3,ncol=3)
G[row(G) != col(G)] = cos(pi/3)
G
```
